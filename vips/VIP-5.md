# VIP: Reduce emphasis on 'v' prefix of Grow pools

Status: Informational (UI changes are not voted on)

## Summary
Display Vesper Grow pools as "ETH" rather than "vETH", to reduce new
user confusion.

## Abstract
As a goal, Vesper seeks a simple and safe user experience.  On Vesper's
social channels, it is observed that the "ETH" vs "vETH" must be
explained.

Change this experience to simply "deposit ETH", plain and clear
language.

## Expectations

Unless the community expresses dislike, the UI team will update the
UI/dapp according to the lines of this proposal.

## Specification

* Remove 'v' prefix from pool cards on the **website**
* Remove 'v' prefix from **dapp** pool list's pool names
* Remove the "estimated receive: nnn.nn veth" from the **dapp** transaction popup.
