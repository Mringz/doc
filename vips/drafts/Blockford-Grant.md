## Abstract

This grant will enable a new fund that leverages Vesper products to maximize returns through Vesper Grow pools (including vVSP) and liquidity providing.

25% of Blockford management fees will be shared with the Vesper community through open market buyback of VSP and delivery to the vVSP pool.
