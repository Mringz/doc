# Vesper Beta: Rules, Boundaries and Limitations

Participate cautiously, provide feedback and set expectations appropriately.  Professional engineering practices demand testing.
## General
* These contracts have been mainnet-tested internally and audited by two independent auditing firms.
* Nevertheless, bugs are always possible.  A beta test period exists to reduce risk, by providing a wider, yet still limited, public product test.
* The Vesper team and community, will be guided by the [Vesper Core Principles](https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1).
* This is a real money beta test of the first 3 Vesper holding pools.
* The beta test will run “until its ready”   Rough estimate is 2-4 weeks.
## Deployment
* It is possible, but unlikely, that the pools, strategies and controllers may need to be redeployed.
* These pools will likely be the production holding pools.  Assets deposited during beta do not need to be touched or moved (unless a bug forcing redeployment occurs), and will become assets in the production pools upon V2 production launch.
## Governance
* VSP token and governance system is not yet deployed.
* Governance is currently via multisig + controller contract.
## Economics and Operations
* Deposits may be paused, if AUM exceeds our preferred beta range (< 25M).
* Deposits and withdrawals may be paused, if an emergency condition occurs.
* Fees are temporarily collected in the multisig account.  Later, this will be run through the revenue system.
* Beta rewards are described [in this document](https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vesper-incentivized-beta-launch-dec-22-a844976b41f6).
## Feedback
* Preferred venue is the #beta-feedback channel on Vesper discord.
