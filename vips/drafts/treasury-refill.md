# VIP: Redirect portion of VSP revenue stream to DAO treasury
## Summary
Redirect portion of VSP revenue stream to DAO treasury.

## Abstract
As of this writing, early in Vesper's life, VSP rewards were pre-minted
and budgeted as form of bootstrapping.  This winds down over 12 months.

This VIP introduces the first phase of the Sustainable DAO Treasury
effort, by redirecting a small portion of buyback VSP to DAO treasury,
rather than VVSP pool as is currently done.

## Expectations
This proposal greenlights the redirect of at most 5% of the total
buyback stream to DAO treasury at
0x9520b477Aa81180E6DdC006Fc09Fb6d3eb4e807A.

It is the intention to *likely increase* from 5% to a higher number in
the future, adjusting as sustainability needs of the DAO dictate, as the
Sustainable DAO Treasury effort continues in further votes and further
phases.

## Specification

At present, buyback VSP split 95% VVSP, 5% pool developers (the
founders).  After this VIP is accepted by the community, the split
becomes 90% VVSP, 5% DAO treasury, 5% pool developers.
