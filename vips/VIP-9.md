# VIP: Treasury V2

Status: Pending

## Summary

Lessons learned in the first 5+ months of Vesper’s existence have spawned discussion community-wide on an upgraded “Treasury V2”.  

This proposal outlines the major areas of improvement and packages a comprehensive set of terms for improving Vesper’s emissions, revenue, treasury management, and budgeting.

## Abstract

The proposal outlined below is for a more sustainable Vesper Treasury model. Following discussions with the community, Vesper Brewing Co. has identified four areas of improvement with proposed solutions for a more sustainable future:
* **Emissions**: Correct the VSP over-subsidization of pools and create a global emissions budget that can scale as new pools arrive.
* **Revenue Model**: Introduce a capped revenue draw to replenish and grow the treasury for continued Vesper operations.
* **Fee structure**: Impose more intentional fees per-product that better reflects the offering presented to users.
* **Budgeting and Treasury Management**: Outline a template for expenditures and impose quantitative requirements.  

## Expectations

**Emissions**

 The global VSP fund reflects the outstanding proposed emissions schedule in an earlier VIP:
* Month 7 (starts August 17): 120,000 VSP
* Month 8: 90,000 VSP
* Month 9: 67,500 VSP
* Month 10: 52,500 VSP
* Month 11: 40,000 VSP
* Month 12: 35,000 VSP
* Month 13+: 30,000 VSP
 Point allocation will rebalance each month based on TVL, with greater TVL awarding higher weight.
* #1 highest TVL pool: 5 points
* 2-3: 4 points
* 4-5: 3 points
* 6-8: 2 points
* 9+: 1 point
New pools will automatically be allocated 3 points for the first month after launch and 2 points for the second month, and are absorbed into the above methodology starting their third month.

LP rewards will have separate emissions, reflective of the existing schedule. (Uniswap LP program is prefunded through Month 12 and will be integrated on Month 13, hence the emissions increase).
* Month 7-12: 34,500 VSP
* Month 13+: 45,000 VSP
Point allocation (based on trading volume)
* SushiSwap: 5 points
* #1 highest volume (excluding SushiSwap on ETH Layer 1): 3 points
* 2-3: 2 points
* 4+: 1 point
New markets start with 2 point allocation in their two months, and are absorbed into the above methodology starting their third month.

## Revenue Model

Ramp-up to 45% split from revenue draw to the treasury over the course of two months. This split is nullified whenever the treasury address (0x95…) possesses in excess of $20 million in non-VSP or VSP LP assets. 

## Fee Structure

Stablecoin Conservative Pools withdrawal fees will remain 0.6%. Non-stablecoin Conservative Pools will see a withdrawal fee reduction to 0.3%. The interest fee will remain 15% across all pools. 

## Budgeting and Treasury Management

Vesper DAO to publish budgeting, expenditure reports, and payment proposals with deployment of treasury. Require quarterly budget proposals and retroactive quarterly budget reports. Any expenditure in excess of $250,000 to pass through vote before execution.

## Specification

VSP administrators to make proposed upgrades and pertinent treasury accounts to be handed over to DAO governance.
