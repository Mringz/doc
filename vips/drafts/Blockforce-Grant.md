# VIP: $100k Grant to Blockforce Capital

## Summary
Award $100k worth of VSP from OpComms budget to Blockforce Capital for their work in integrating Vesper products in investments on behalf of their clients.

## Abstract

Blockforce Capital manages a multi-strategy hedgefund that targets digital assets.

This grant will enable a new fund that leverages Vesper products to maximize returns through Vesper Grow pools (including vVSP) and liquidity providing.

This proposal introduces a first-of-its-kind public/private partnership that will enable accredited investors to access Vesper in a wholly compliant manner.

As part of this grant, Blockforce Capital will also share management fees with the Vesper community through VSP buybacks that will be delivered to vVSP depositors in the same manner as our existing buybacks.

## Expectations

The $100,000 grant enables Blockforce Capital to take on the miscellaneous legal, administrative, and regulatory costs to enable such a fund to exist in a wholly compliant capacity.

The fund will incorporate volatile digital assets (VSP, WBTC, ETH) and stablecoins (USDC, DAI) alike, which will be deposited to Vesper to earn yield.

25% of Blockford management fees will be shared with the Vesper community through open market buyback of VSP and delivery to the vVSP pool.
